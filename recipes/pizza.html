    <h4>
      Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread
      dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives,
      mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked
      quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated
      to a very high temperature—and served hot.

    <ul>
      <h3>For the base</h3>
      <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
      <li>1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
      <h3>For the tomato sauce</h3>
      <li>100ml passata</li>
      <li>handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried</li>
      <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
      <h3>For the topping</h3>
      <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced</li>
      <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
      <li>handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>

        STEP 1. Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the
        yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil
        and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet
        dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until
        smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to
        rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.

        STEP 2. Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic
        together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while
        you get on with shaping the base.

      <br />s with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese
        and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on
        its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10
        mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves
        if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
